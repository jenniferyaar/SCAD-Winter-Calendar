To use the SCAD ICS FULL COMPILER PROMPT, you must attach or paste:

1) The current production ICS file (authoritative structure)
2) All syllabus PDFs (CTXT 122, FOUN 112, FOUN 220)
3) Any syllabus overrides or updates (only the changed text)
4) (Optional) A short goal statement, e.g.:
   - “Rebuild Weeks 1–4 descriptions from templates”
   - “Regenerate entire semester calendar”

Paste the prompt FIRST, then attach the files.
If the assistant asks clarifying questions, answer them before expecting output.
