To use SCAD ICS DIFF MODE, attach exactly:

1) The current production ICS file
2) A clear list of diff instructions (UID-based or scoped)
3) (Optional) Only the updated syllabus text relevant to the change

Do NOT attach full syllabi unless they are required for the diff.
The assistant should not re-author untouched blocks.
