## DELIVERABLE + DEFINITION OF DONE

Deliverable 1: Color Study Sheet
- [ ] 1–2 finished studies
- [ ] Clear value hierarchy (light/mid/dark)
- [ ] Hue/saturation choices support intended mood


## HOW TO USE CHATGPT

- Clarify: "Explain hue/value/saturation using my palette and intended mood."
- Generate: "Suggest 3 alternate palettes that keep mood but improve value hierarchy."
- Quality check: "Do my choices match Sherin Ch.1 principles? What adjust first?"
- Next-step plan: "Fast iteration plan to improve contrast without changing mood."

## CONTINGENCIES / EXTRA HELP ALIGNMENT

- If stuck, bring 2 iterations + your reflection to help; ask what single variable to change first.
