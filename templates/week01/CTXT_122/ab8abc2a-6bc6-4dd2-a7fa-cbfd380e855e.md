## HOW TO USE CHATGPT

- Clarify: "Explain today’s key claim in 3 sentences and give one example that fits."
- Generate: "Give me 3 discussion questions based on my chosen image/example."
- Quality check: "Are my notes analytical (not descriptive)? What is missing?"
- Next-step plan: "Give me a 15-minute revision plan to strengthen claim + evidence."

## CONTINGENCIES / EXTRA HELP ALIGNMENT

- If stuck, stop after Visual Evidence Analysis; bring partial worksheet + one confusion question to class/help.
