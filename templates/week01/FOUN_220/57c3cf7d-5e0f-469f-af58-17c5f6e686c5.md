## GOAL

Practice Week 1 gesture + light/value foundations and produce critique-ready Gesture Sheet + Value Studies.

## WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN THIS BLOCK

Train fast gesture confidence + simplified value grouping so forms read as 3D under a consistent light source.

## TODAY'S MICRO-TASKS (WITH FILL-IN TEMPLATES)

Micro-task 1 — Gesture Set → Deliverable 1: Gesture Sheet

**Gesture set completed** *(~4–10 words)*
Your answer: [                                                                 ]
Example (do not copy): *10 gestures at 45s each*

**Two priorities** *(~3–8 words each)*
- Priority A: [                               ]  Example (do not copy): *continuous confident lines*
- Priority B: [                               ]  Example (do not copy): *clear line of action*

Micro-task 2 — Value Study Plan → Deliverable 2: Value Studies

**Object chosen** *(~2–6 words)*
Your answer: [                                                                 ]
Example (do not copy): *white mug*

**Light source direction** *(~2–6 words)*
Your answer: [                                                                 ]
Example (do not copy): *top-left desk lamp*

**3-value plan (light/mid/dark)** *(~10–20 words)*
Your answer: [                                                                 ]
Example (do not copy): *light=highlight, mid=local tone, dark=cast shadow*

Micro-task 3 — Value Studies + Reflection → Deliverable 2: Value Studies

**Study count** *(~1–4 words)*
Your answer: [                                                                 ]
Example (do not copy): *5 studies*

**Reflection (hardest thing)** *(~1–2 sentences)*
Your answer: [                                                                 ]
Example (do not copy): *Keeping shadow shapes simple without blending too much.*


## DELIVERABLE + DEFINITION OF DONE

Deliverable 1: Gesture Sheet
- [ ] 8–12 gestures
- [ ] Confident continuous lines
- [ ] Clear line of action

Deliverable 2: Value Studies
- [ ] 4–6 value studies
- [ ] Clear light/mid/dark grouping
- [ ] Forms read as 3D


## HOW TO USE CHATGPT

- Clarify: "What should I prioritize in gesture today—energy, proportion, or contour?"
- Drills: "Give me 3 quick value drills to improve light/shadow readability in 15 minutes."
- Quality check: "Based on my reflection, what is the #1 fix to make forms read as 3D?"
- Next-step plan: "What should tomorrow’s warm-up be if my lines are hesitant?"

## CONTINGENCIES / EXTRA HELP ALIGNMENT

- If stuck, bring 2 iterations + your reflection to help; ask what single variable to change first.
